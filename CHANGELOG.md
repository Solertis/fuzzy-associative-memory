# Changelog for fuzzy-associative-memory

## 1.0.1, 28 June 2013
* Based on good feedback, revised the initializer for `Rule` to put the `natural_language` parameter at the end and make it optional. I realize this is a disruptive alteration to the API and I apologize for the code adjustments this will necessitate.

## 1.0.0, 26 June 2013
* Initial Gem release
